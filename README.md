## Vision Mapping Processor Command Line Interface.
Complete tasks based on created visions.

Without a vision there is no hope, a vision is a tangible timed mapped view for me, which includes precise and calculted steps.

This is my tool, where I can make an excuse to write some C, and develop something that can help me develop products into market.


## Raw is how I luv it!
Sqlite3 + C = Luv

I also need to be able to run this anywhere, make fast actions, while developing in my terminal.
